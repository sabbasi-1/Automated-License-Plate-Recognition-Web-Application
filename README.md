# Automated-License-Plate-Recognition-Web-Application

This is the AI part of a web-based
system developed using YOLOv8 and OCR to automatically extract vehicle license plates from surveillance footage.
The system cross-checked extracted plates with an authorized parking list, placing unauthorized vehicles on
a grey list. If a grey-listed vehicle remained for over an hour, it was blacklisted, triggering alerts for further
action.
